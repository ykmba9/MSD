    <p>*FAMOUS MS DHONI'S QUOTES:</p>
    <br/>
    <p>1 * "If you don't really have a dream, you can't really push yourself; you don't really know what the target is" *</p>
</br>
    <p>2 * "It's important to learn and not repeat the same mistakes. What's done is done" *</p>
</br>
    <p>3 * "For me, it's important to build good partnerships rather than score centuries. Once, you have those partnerships, you will also get centuries" *</p>
</br>
    <p>4 * "I have three dogs at home. Even after losing a series or winning a series, they treat me the same way" *</p>
</br>
    <P>5 * "Gut feeling is all about the experiences that you have had in your life. It is about being in difficult scenarios, knowing what worked, what did not work, and then taking a decision" *</P>
</br>
    <p>6 * "I believe in giving more than 100% on the field, and I don't really worry about the result if there's great commitment on the field. That's victory for me" *</p>
</br>
    <P>7 * "Nobody has seen form. It's a state of mind where you are confident and you think very positively" *</P>
</br>
    <p>8 * "There is a fine line between cooked and over-cooked. If you do a barbeque, you can understand that" *</p>
</br>
    <p>9 * "Till the full stop does not come, the sentence is not complete" *</p>
</br>
    <P>10 * "You have every right to ask me that. It's your prerogative. But I have the right to not answer" *</P>
</br>
<p>11 * "When you Die, You Die. You don't think which is the better way to Die" *</p>
</br>
<p>12 * "For me, Opposition is just another Opposition" *</p>
</br>
<p>13 * "It's like having 100kg put over you. After that even if you put a mountain, it will not make a difference" *</p>
</br>
<p>14 * "My wife wants me to eat fish, she says it's delicious. But I dont like fish, so that is that" *:))</p>
